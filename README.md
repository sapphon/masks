# Mask Up
A modeling and simulation tool for use of cloth face masks in an infectious disease scenario.

## Intent
At best, this tool could educate someone about the use of various types of face mask by different classes of wearer in an outbreak of infectious disease in which spread is achieved through aerosolized droplets.

At absolute worst, the creation of this tool will divert its author(s) during one such outbreak.

## Development
You can monitor development at the public Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/NCfB8z2T/mask-sim).
