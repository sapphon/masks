# Mask Up
A modeling and simulation tool for use of cloth face masks in an infectious disease scenario.

## Intent
At best, this tool could educate someone about the use of various types of face mask by different classes of wearer in an outbreak of infectious disease in which spread is achieved through aerosolized droplets.

At absolute worst, the creation of this tool will divert its author(s) during one such outbreak.

## How to Use
Only a (very boring) proof of concept map is working right now.  A public version of the simulation will be made available when the simulation is integrated with a map representing a realistic walkable downtown.

## Development
You can monitor development at the public Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/NCfB8z2T/mask-sim).

The simulation is a standard [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) project built using the free 2018.4.18f1 release.  You will need that software (or if unavailable, a later version) to develop the project.

### Disclaimer
I am not an epidemiologist.  I'm not qualified to study diseases!  I'm just qualified to make simulations.  Accordingly, if you have epidemiological or modeling feedback for me, it's quite welcome - please don't hesitate.
